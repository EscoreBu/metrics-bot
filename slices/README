put your application slices here

skeleton of one slice:

slice_name
+-- app
|   +-- controllers
|   +-- models
|   +-- views
+-- config
|   +-- router.php
+-- public

in the router.php you should map routes like this:

$ROUTER->map_connect('my_route', array("controller" => "controller"), true);

note the true at end, this force the route to be at top of priority (since the routes of slices are added after
the app routes, its almost always needed)
